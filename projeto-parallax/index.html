            I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone <br>
            You bled me dry just like the tears you never show <br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me? <br>
            Take what you need from me <br>
            Take what you want and go <br>

            I never needed anything from you <br>
            And all I ever asked was for the truth <br>
            You showed your tongue and it was forked in two <br>
            Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you <br>
            Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake <br>
            Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown <br>
            Like a plague, I was wasting away <br>
            Tryna find my way out, find my way out. <br>

            And it finally came the day<br>
            I start giving my heart away<br>
            For heaven's sake, my bones will break<br>
            But you'll never own my soul, no<br>
        </p>

            I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone <br>

            I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew <br>
            I brought up ten hoes, this coupé only made for two<br>
            They all ran through it, it ain't nothing left to do<br>
            I need some more reasons to live out this evening <br>
            I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever<br>
            Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around<br>
            Let's go our ways, whichever<br>
            You say how is however long<br>
            'Cause you know I never be alone<br>

            Love (love)
            Shorty gon' back <br>
            Need it on sight <br>
            Crack it all back <br>
            Give her that pipe<br>
            All of my cash <br>
            Shawty went bad <br>
